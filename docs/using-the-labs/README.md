Please wait for the server to be provisioned and do NOT click on the Refresh button during this process. It takes upto 5 minutes for the dedicated lab to be provisioned for you.

Once the lab is provisioned, you'll be able to access it by clicking on the lab link here

Once you click on the lab link, you'll have an additional browser tab open that will give you direct shell access to the server right from your browser.

Usually, your server expires after a particular time automatically. Howver, you can stop the server (destroying the lab environment) by clicking on the button indicated below

> Remember, all the servers that you provision are dedicated to you and for you, for the entire length of the training.

> The date and time indicate when the server will automatically shut-off. If that happens, don't worry. You can always re-provision the server as you provisioned it the first time. 

> You can concurrently provision only one server. Althought, you may have multiple servers running at the same time.
